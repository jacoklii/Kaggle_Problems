Supervised and unsupervised:
Supervised:
* Knows the data
* Learns from data with answers
* Labeled dataset (correct answers or classification)
* After new set of examples (data) so it can analyses the training data and produce correct outcome for labeled data


Types of Supervised Learning:
Regression:
* To predict continuous values (house prices, stock prices, temp)
* Learns how to connect input data to specific numbers or values


Algorithm Types for Regression:
* Linear regression (simple)
* Polynomial regression
* Lasso regression
* Ridge regression


        Classification:
* To predict categorical values (whether a customer will buy or not, email is spam or not, medical image shows tumor or not)
* Connect input data to the probability of belonging to different groups/categories


Algorithm types for Regression:
* Logistic regression 
* Support vector machine (simple)
* Decision trees
* Random forests
* Naive Baye


Applications for supervised learning:
Image classification: 
* Automatically classify images into diff categories
* Search
* Recommendations
Medical diagnosis:
* Analyzing patient data, test result, client history
* To identify patterns
Fraud detection:
* Analyzes financial transactions
Natural language processing: (nlp)
* Important role in this
* Sentiment analysis
* Machine translation, Text summarization
* Helps understand and process human language efficiently


Advantages:
* Learns from labeled data (data with answers) to make accurate predictions on new unseen data


* Increases accuracy with more data and training → better performance
* Works well with many tasks


* ​​has the ability to handle various computational challenges.


* It can handle both classification (sorting into categories) and regression (predict numbers), makes it flexible for diff problems


Disadvantages:
* Requires well labeled dataset with function (corresponding output)


* Creating datasets take long time, money, effort (makes hard to use)


* struggles with complex unstructured problems like understanding ideas or patterns that wasn't trained for


* Sometimes overfit training data (good with training data, bad at new, unseen data)


* Constant updating with new labeled data to stay accurate in real world data changes over time


Unsupervised:
* No supervisor to guide for machine
* Input raw data —> Interpretation → algorithm → processing —> Output
* Finds hidden patterns in data without answers
* No labels/catagories
* Analyzes data on its own to find patterns and relationships/groups with no prior knowledge
* Hidden structures
* Not told the correct output






Types of unsupervised learning:
        Clustering:
* Repeatedly moving data points closer to the center of the group and further from points in other groups
* Helps algorithms create clear clusters
Algorithm types for Clustering:
* K-means clustering
* Hierarchical clustering
* Principle concept analysis (PCA)
* Singular value decomposition (SVD)
* Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
* Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
        Association rule learning:
* Used to find patterns and relationships between different datasets 
* (people who buy x will often buy y)
Algorithm types for Association Rule:
* Apriori Algorithm
* Eclat Algorithm
* FP-Growth Algorithm


Applications of unsupervised learning:
Anomaly detection:
* It can identify unusual patterns or behaviors in data
* Helps the detection of fraud, security breaches, or system problems
Scientific discovery:
* Show hidden relations and patterns in scientific data which leads to new insights and ideas
Recommendation systems:
* Find similarities in user behavior and preferences to recommend products that align with interests
Customer recommendation:
* It can identify groups of customers with similar interests which allow businesses to target market campaigns, and improve customer service


Advantages:
* Doesn't need labeled data 
* Can start working with large datasets, quicker and easier
* Handles large amounts of data and reduces into simpler forms while keeping important patterns
* Makes manageable and efficient
* Discovers patterns and relations that were unknown which offers valuable insights
* Analyzes unlabeled data to show meaningful trends and groups that help us to understand our data deeply.




Disadvantages:
* Difficult to tell accuracy with model with unlabeled data
* Lack of clear guidance can lead to less precise results for complex problems
* After grouping data, we may need to check and label these which takes up time
* Missing data, outliers, or noise can easily affect quality of results
